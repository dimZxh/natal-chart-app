You are a React performance optimization expert. I have a natal chart application built with React that visualizes astrological charts based on user input birth details.

The application includes these key components:
1. NatalChart.js - Renders an SVG-based astrological chart with interactive elements
2. BirthDataForm.js - Handles user input with form validation
3. EnhancedDatePicker.js - Custom date picker implementation
4. Several UI components like Button and LoadingSpinner

The chart has interactive features like zooming, panning, and tooltips when hovering over planets. The SVG can become complex with many elements when rendering aspects between planets.

Please provide specific code optimizations to improve the performance focusing on:

1. React rendering optimizations (useMemo, useCallback, memo)
2. SVG rendering performance improvements
3. Form handling optimizations
4. Any other performance bottlenecks you can identify

For each suggestion, please provide the specific code changes needed with before/after examples.
