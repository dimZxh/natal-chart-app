You are a senior React developer specializing in accessibility and user experience. I have a natal chart application built with React that allows users to input their birth details and view their astrological natal chart.

I've recently improved the UI with the following components:
1. An enhanced date picker
2. Interactive chart with zoom and pan functionality
3. Custom button components
4. Loading spinner

I want to make my application more accessible. Please provide specific suggestions to improve accessibility in these components. Focus on:

1. ARIA attributes that may be missing
2. Keyboard navigation improvements
3. Screen reader compatibility
4. Color contrast issues

For each suggestion, please provide the specific code snippet that needs to be changed, along with the improved code.
